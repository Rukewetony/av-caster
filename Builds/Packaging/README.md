the arch PKGBUILD file contained in this directory is somewhat brittle in that the md5sum property refers to a tarball that is yet to be acquired - which in the case of a git repo is created automatically based on the last commit - so it is not possible to include this checksum in the git repo itself because doing so would necessarily cause the checksum to change - therefore arch users must first download the tarball then run md5sum on it - then modify the value of md5sums in the PKGBUILD file to match (at least until we ask the arch peeps if there is a better way of handling this)

the remaining files contained in this directory are used by travis to package binary artifacts and are otherwise not interesting
